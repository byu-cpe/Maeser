# Maeser
## Overview
This package is designed to facilitate the creation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot applications, specifically tailored for educational purposes. It leverages the capabilities of [LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/), a powerful tool for serving RAG pipelines, to provide a robust backend for chatbot interactions.

Detailed documentation can be found [here](byu-cpe.github.io/Maeser/).
## Features
- **RAG Pipeline Integration**: Utilizes LangGraph to seamlessly integrate RAG pipelines into the chatbot, enhancing its ability to generate informative and contextually relevant responses.
- **Session Management**: Comes equipped with a session manager to handle interactions efficiently, ensuring a smooth and coherent conversation flow.
- **Web Interface**: Includes optional prebuilt Flask applications, making it easy to deploy the chatbot on a web browser for accessible and interactive user experiences.
- **Terminal Interface**: Offers a simple terminal interface for users who prefer a more straightforward method of interaction, making it versatile for different use cases.
## Potential Use Cases
* Help students study for an exam
  * Generate example problems
* Provide guided help for students completing homework
  * Not giving them the answers but providing hints and guided help to step them through the problems
  * Pointing the students back to the textbook or slides when guiding them
* Assist them in completing the labs
  * Review their code and provide feedback
  * Help them resolve common issues such as issues with the Vivado tools
